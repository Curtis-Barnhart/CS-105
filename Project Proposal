1. Language:
C++

1.1 Why
We are all interested in getting to know it as it seems to be well adopted in the industry.

2. What Program:
Ray tracing/renderer.

2.1 Justification
Our project will highlight the speed of C++ and its ability to deal well with intense mathematical computation.

There's not much that we have to figure out ourselves in terms of math and so we should be able to spend our time on the actual code.
There's nothing particularly weird about ray tracing - it is a well trodden path that hopefully shouldn't be too hard for us to walk down.
On the other hand, there should be plenty of room to expand the project as necessary, whether that be with a time component and movement,
different and more complex types of material, or more.
